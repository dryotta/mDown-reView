# Review Comments

## What it is

The core workflow of the app: a user reviewing AI-generated files selects a span of text, leaves an inline comment, replies, resolves, and moves on. Comments are threaded, line-anchored, indestructible across refactors, and persisted to disk next to the reviewed file — never to a database or a cloud service.

## How it works

Persistence lives in per-file MRSF sidecars (`foo.md` → `foo.md.review.yaml`). The MRSF v1.0 schema, atomic write protocol, and sidecar lifecycle are defined in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md) and [`docs/security.md`](../security.md). Rust is the source of truth: React asks for comments via a typed command, renders them, and sends mutations back — the frontend never writes YAML.

Anchoring survives file edits through a 4-step algorithm — exact match at original line, full-document exact search, line fallback, fuzzy Levenshtein, then orphan. The algorithm is implemented in Rust core and specified in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md) §4-step re-anchoring. Orphaned comments never disappear silently — they surface in the `DeletedFileViewer` when their file is removed, and in an orphan banner when their anchor text no longer matches.

### Anchor variants (v1.1)

Beyond the v1.0 `Line` anchor, MRSF v1.1 adds six non-line variants for content where line numbers don't apply: `Image_rect` (percentage-coordinate region on a bitmap), `Csv_cell` (row + col + header + optional primary key), `Json_path` (JSONPath + optional scalar value), `Html_range` (CSS selector + offset range + selected text), `Html_element` (CSS selector + tag + preview), and `Word_range`. `Word_range` pins comments to a UAX#29-tokenized span (start..end word indices on the line) plus a normalized text snippet — see `core/word_tokens.rs` and `core/types/mod.rs::WordRangePayload`. A further variant, `File`, anchors a comment to the whole file. Each typed variant has a heuristic resolver in `src-tauri/src/core/anchors/<matcher>.rs` (`image_rect.rs`, `csv_cell.rs`, `json_path.rs`, `html.rs`, `word_range.rs`) dispatched through `resolve_anchor` in `core/anchors/mod.rs`. The wire layout is FLAT (`anchor_kind` discriminator + per-variant payload sibling) so the v1.0 round-trip stays byte-identical for pure line anchors; the in-memory canonical form is the tagged `Anchor` enum (`src/types/comments.ts`, `src-tauri/src/core/types/mod.rs`). When a file is refactored and a v1.1 anchor cannot resolve, the matcher falls back to `anchor_history` (FIFO cap of 3 prior positions); if every history entry also fails, the comment becomes file-level rather than orphaned. Anchor moves from the UI route through `update_comment` with `CommentPatch::MoveAnchor`, which auto-pushes the prior anchor through the FIFO `push_anchor_history` chokepoint (cap 3) before installing the new one.

The UI surface is a selection toolbar that appears on text selection, a comment input, a threaded reply view, and an aggregated panel that summarises unresolved counts across the workspace. Line-gutter indicators in `SourceView` make every anchored comment discoverable at a glance.

To re-anchor an existing comment, click **Move** on a Line/File-anchored thread: the body switches to crosshair cursor and a sticky banner ("Click a line to move the comment.") appears at the top of the app; clicking any source line in `MarkdownViewer` or `SourceView` re-anchors via `update_comment` (`CommentPatch::MoveAnchor`), and pressing Esc or the banner's Cancel button exits move mode without changes. Missed clicks (anywhere outside a renderable source line) leave move mode active so a stray click never silently cancels. The button is hidden on typed-anchor threads (CSV cell, JSON path, HTML, image rect, word range) where re-anchoring to a Line would lose payload information — edit/delete those instead.

### Author identity

New comments are stamped with a display name configured in the **Settings** dialog (gear button in the top toolbar). The value is persisted to `OnboardingState.author` in the app config directory via the `set_author` Tauri command, with strict validation (≤128 bytes, no control characters, no newlines) returning a typed `ConfigError` discriminator on rejection.

On every launch the renderer hydrates the cached display name via `get_author`, which falls back to the OS user — `USERNAME` (Windows) or `USER` (macOS / Linux), and finally `"anonymous"` — when nothing has been saved. This is read synchronously from the Zustand `authorName` cache by every `add_comment` call site (`useCommentActions`), so creating a comment never blocks on an IPC round-trip.

There is no authentication and no cloud component: the display name is purely a local label written into the MRSF sidecar alongside each comment. To use the env-var path, no extra crate is pulled in (Lean pillar — see [`docs/principles.md`](../principles.md)).

## Key source

- **UI components:** `src/components/comments/{CommentInput,CommentThread,CommentsPanel,CommentBadge,LineCommentMargin,SelectionToolbar}.tsx`; `src/components/SettingsDialog.tsx` (display-name field)
- **TypeScript types:** `src/types/comments.ts` — Anchor discriminated union, `MrsfComment`, `deriveAnchor` adapter (mirrors Rust `core/types/wire.rs`)
- **Hooks:** `src/hooks/{useSelectionToolbar,useThreadsByLine,useFileBadges}.ts`; `src/lib/vm/useAuthor.ts` (display-name VM, hydrates `authorName` on launch)
- **Store slice:** `src/store/index.ts` — `commentsSlice`
- **Rust core:** `src-tauri/src/core/{anchors,matching,sidecar/,types/,word_tokens,comments,threads,severity,export,mrsf_version}.rs`
- **Commands:** `src-tauri/src/commands/comments/{mod.rs,badges.rs,export.rs,update.rs}` — `get_file_comments`, `add_comment`, `add_reply`, `edit_comment`, `delete_comment`, `compute_anchor_hash`, `tokenize_words`, `update_comment`, `get_file_badges`, `export_review_summary`; `src-tauri/src/commands/config.rs` — `set_author`, `get_author`; `src-tauri/src/commands/launch.rs` — `scan_review_files`
- **Anchor resolver:** `src-tauri/src/core/anchors/mod.rs` — `resolve_anchor(&Anchor, &LazyParsedDoc) -> MatchOutcome` is the per-typed-anchor dispatcher invoked by `get_file_comments`, with heuristic resolvers per matcher: `image_rect.rs` (no-op coordinate validation), `csv_cell.rs` (header + primary-key lookup), `json_path.rs` (JSONPath traversal with optional scalar check), `html.rs` (HtmlRange + HtmlElement selector match), `word_range.rs` (UAX#29 word-index span verification). `LazyParsedDoc` (`OnceCell`) caches one parse per file per call regardless of comment count. `FileBadge.orphan_count` is not yet populated by the badge path — current badges count typed anchors as `Exact`; lazy orphan classification in the badge path is deferred to a future iter.
